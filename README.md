**Automated sending of messages in iMessage**

Use steps:
1. Open shortcuts from the repository.
2. Add numbers to the "List" block to which the mailing will be sent.
3. Run the script.
4. In the pop-up window, select files to send.
5. Open the clicker (for example - https://github.com/othyn/macos-auto-clicker).
6. Set a click on the button to send the message (set clicks with a reserve/infinite, it is better with a gap between clicks of ~20 seconds).
7. After the mailing is finished, turn off the clicker (it will click on the inactive area until it performs all the clicks, or until it is stopped).
