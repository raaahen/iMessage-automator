**Automated sending of messages in iMessage**

Use steps:
1. Open iMessage.shortcut from the repository in Shortcuts App on Mac.
2. Add numbers to the "List" block to which the mailing will be sent.
3. Run the shortcuts.
4. In the pop-up window, select files to send.
5. Open the clicker (I recommended - https://github.com/othyn/macos-auto-clicker).
6. Set a click on the button to send the message (set clicks with a reserve/infinite, it is better with a gap between clicks of ~20 seconds).
7. After the mailing is finished, turn off the clicker (it will click on the inactive area until it performs all the clicks, or until it is stopped).
